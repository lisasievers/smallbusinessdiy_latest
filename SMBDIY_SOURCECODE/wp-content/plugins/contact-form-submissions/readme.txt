Never miss an enquiry again! Save & Export your Contact Form 7 submissions.

== Description ==

Easy install, no configuration necessary. Once activated all contact form 7 submissions will be saved so you can view them in wp-admin.

Each submission is stored in the database so they can be easily managed using the default WordPress interface. You can filter subsmissions by searching for keywords, selecting individual contact forms or picking a date range. To show the posted values in the listing table just filter the submissions by a form.

Files are stored in the /wp-content/uploads directory and can be previewed or downloaded from the single submission page.

All submissions can be exported in CSV format using the export button.

This plugin has been made with no ads or donation links so you can use this on all your sites.
